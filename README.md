# Nova Electric Racing – ECU Firmware

This repository contains the firmware for the **Electronic Control Unit (ECU)** developed by the **Nova Electric Racing Dream Team**  
👉 https://novaracing.nl

The firmware is intended to run on an **STM32F767ZI** microcontroller and is currently developed and tested using the **STM32 NUCLEO-144 MB1137** development board.  
(ST user manual: https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um1974-stm32-nucleo144-boards-mb1137-stmicroelectronics.pdf)

## Project Status
The codebase is **under active development**.

The next planned milestone is:
- **Calibration of the EMRAX 268 electric motor**
- **Initial motor spin test**

**Target date:** third week of January 2026

## Notes
This project is part of an ongoing student-led electric motorcycle development effort.  
Interfaces, parameters, and control logic are expected to evolve as testing progresses.
